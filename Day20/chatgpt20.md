### Day 20: Sensor Interfacing and Data Acquisition in Embedded Systems

Today, we'll explore the fundamentals of sensor interfacing and data acquisition techniques in embedded systems. Sensors are essential components that enable embedded systems to interact with the physical world by detecting and measuring various environmental parameters.

#### 1. Introduction to Sensors in Embedded Systems

Sensors convert physical quantities (such as temperature, pressure, light) into electrical signals that can be processed by microcontrollers or embedded systems.

#### 2. Types of Sensors

**2.1. Analog Sensors**

Analog sensors output a continuous voltage or current proportional to the measured quantity. They require analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) for interfacing with digital microcontrollers.

**Example: Interfacing Analog Sensor**

```cpp
const int sensorPin = A0; // Analog input pin for sensor

void setup() {
    Serial.begin(9600); // Initialize serial communication
}

void loop() {
    int sensorValue = analogRead(sensorPin); // Read analog sensor value
    float voltage = sensorValue * (5.0 / 1023.0); // Convert to voltage (assuming 5V Vref)
    
    Serial.print("Sensor Value: ");
    Serial.print(sensorValue);
    Serial.print(", Voltage: ");
    Serial.println(voltage);

    delay(1000); // Delay for 1 second
}
```

**Explanation:**
- `analogRead(sensorPin)`: Reads analog sensor value from pin A0.
- Conversion to voltage assumes a 10-bit ADC with 5V reference.

**2.2. Digital Sensors**

Digital sensors output discrete digital signals (e.g., HIGH or LOW) and communicate over protocols such as I2C, SPI, or UART.

**Example: Interfacing Digital Sensor (I2C)**

```cpp
#include <Wire.h>

#define SENSOR_ADDRESS 0x68 // I2C address of the sensor

void setup() {
    Wire.begin(); // Initialize I2C communication
    Serial.begin(9600); // Initialize serial communication
}

void loop() {
    Wire.requestFrom(SENSOR_ADDRESS, 2); // Request 2 bytes of data from sensor

    while (Wire.available()) {
        int sensorData = Wire.read(); // Read data from sensor
        Serial.print("Sensor Data: ");
        Serial.println(sensorData);
    }

    delay(1000); // Delay for 1 second
}
```

**Explanation:**
- `Wire.requestFrom(SENSOR_ADDRESS, 2)`: Requests 2 bytes of data from sensor via I2C.
- Data is read and printed to serial monitor.

#### 3. Signal Conditioning

Signal conditioning involves amplifying, filtering, or converting sensor signals to ensure accuracy and compatibility with microcontroller input requirements.

#### 4. Data Acquisition Techniques

**4.1. Sampling and Conversion**

- **Sampling Rate:** Frequency of data acquisition (e.g., samples per second).
- **Resolution:** Number of bits used for ADC conversion (e.g., 8-bit, 10-bit).

**4.2. Interrupt-Driven Data Acquisition**

Use interrupts to handle sensor data asynchronously, allowing the microcontroller to perform other tasks while awaiting sensor input.

#### 5. Calibration and Accuracy

Calibrate sensors to correct for inaccuracies or variations in sensor readings, ensuring reliable and consistent data acquisition.

#### Daily Challenge:
1. Interface an analog sensor (e.g., temperature sensor, light sensor) with your embedded project.
2. Implement communication with a digital sensor (e.g., using I2C or SPI protocol).
3. Explore signal conditioning techniques to improve sensor data accuracy.
4. Experiment with different data acquisition methods (e.g., polling vs. interrupt-driven) and measure their impact on system performance.
